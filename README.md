# ETF Forecasts

In this project we are using historic ETF data from Yahoo Finance to predict/forecast historic ETF prices. The ETF's we are using are the ARK Innovation Fund (Ticker: ARKK), the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (Ticker: SPY) and the Bank of Montreal MicroSectors FANG Index (Ticker: FNGU). We are using two machine learning models, the Facebook/Meta Prophet model as well as a Tensorflow LSTM Recurrent Neural Network models to predict/forecast these ETF prices. And we compare and contrast these different models and their performance against the real historic prices.
